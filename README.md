# Comic Frame Extractor 

This is a command-line tool to automatically detect and extract individual frames from a single comic strip or manga page image.

It works by analyzing the image and identifying the "gutters" (the white space) between panels to determine where to cut.

Currently only works by downloading the whole, python script is corrupted. guess this is the limit of the vibe coding. 
But will soon comeback, yea so stay tune.
